# Project documentation
Installation
Prerequisites
Microsoft SQL Server / SQL Management Studio
Python 3.x with packages: pandas, nltk, sqlalchemy, scikit-learn, spacy
Azure Data Studio and MLflow for model tracking
Optional: Flask or Streamlit for deploying the sentiment analysis dashboard
Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Customer-Feedback-Analysis.git
cd Customer-Feedback-Analysis
Install required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas nltk sqlalchemy scikit-learn spacy
Usage
Week 1: SQL Database Setup and Data Collection
Run Wk_01_Dlv_01_SQL_Schema_Tables.sql to create tables for managing feedback.
Use Wk_01_Dlv_02_SQL_Feedback_Queries.sql to extract and summarize feedback data.
Week 2: Data Warehouse and Python Data Processing
Run Wk_02_Dlv_01_SQL_DW_Feedback_Integration.sql to set up and load data into the data warehouse.
Execute Wk_02_Dlv_02_Py_Data_Cleaning_Preprocessing.ipynb to clean and preprocess feedback data for analysis.
Week 3: Sentiment Analysis and Azure Integration
Use Wk_03_Dlv_01_Py_Sentiment_Analysis_Report.ipynb to build, train, and evaluate the sentiment analysis model.
Week 4: MLOps and Final Deployment (In Development)
Use MLflow for tracking model performance and monitor versioning.
Deploy the sentiment model using Flask/Streamlit for visualizing feedback trends.
Results
SQL Database Setup and Management
Established a structured SQL database schema to efficiently store and organize customer feedback data.
Imported historical feedback and developed SQL queries to extract key insights.
Data Warehousing and Processing
Built a data warehouse to support scalable analysis and facilitate easy querying.
Preprocessed feedback data using Python, ensuring clean data ready for NLP processing.
Sentiment Analysis
Developed a sentiment analysis model with high accuracy, categorizing feedback into Positive, Neutral, and Negative.
Challenges and Solutions
SQL-Python Integration: Overcame initial integration issues by standardizing data formats and using SQLAlchemy with Pandas for smoother ETL processes.
Data Cleaning: Addressed inconsistencies and missing data with text normalization and tokenization techniques using NLTK.
Model Training on Limited Data: Enhanced model performance through data augmentation and semi-supervised learning.
Future Work
Deployment and MLOps: Fully integrate MLOps for model tracking and deploy the sentiment analysis model with real-time feedback visualization.
Data Expansion: Explore additional feedback data sources for improved sentiment analysis accuracy.
Azure Transition: Finalize Azure setup for long-term storage and scalable model deployment.
