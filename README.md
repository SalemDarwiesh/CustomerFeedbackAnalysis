# Customer Feedback Data Engineering Project

This project analyzes customer feedback data to deliver actionable insights for product and service improvements. It includes data extraction, transformation, sentiment analysis, and visualization, using Python, SQL, and NLP libraries. The goal is to enable data-driven decisions on customer satisfaction and trends.

## Project Structure
- `data/` - Folder containing sample customer feedback data
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for data processing and analysis
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model development
- `output/` - Folder for processed data and visualization outputs
- `README.md` - Project overview and instructions

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Collects and preprocesses customer feedback data.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans and organizes data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses NLP to classify feedback sentiment.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphs and charts for customer insights.
